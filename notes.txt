Would like the RTs and Acc to be in the plausible range

Would like effect sizes in plausible range to result in realistic power estimates
- need to calculate how drift effect size translates into observed effect size in accurate and RT (both lower?)
- - depends on number of measurements per ppt
- - typically RT and ACC drift is x 0.05 to 0.3
- need to make some assumptions about number of trials

So, 0.1 difference in drift (cohen's d effect size = 2) translates to an ~0.35 effect size for RT and Acc
- how to generate all values of effect size: use increments of drift and calculate observed effect size for behavioural parameters?

? Generate drift effect size : observed effect size ratio for different trial numbers?
